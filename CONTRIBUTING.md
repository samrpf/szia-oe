## Ways to contribute

There are many ways you can contribute.

You could, of course, just start fixing all the issues on the GitHub page,
but we want to give some other ideas to contribute.

Here are some of them.

### Make an app

You could make a szia-integrated app which users could find on their home screen.

This is an app, like the browser, which isn't just a website,
but rather an app that can only be accessed from szia.

For example, the browser is a szia-integrated app.

### Add a feature

Self-explanatory.

You could add any feature to the home screen
just to make szia feel more like an operating environment.

### Do a bounty

In `BOUNTY.md`, there are always new things to do which we want done.

These could be issues with the current environment,
or small features we'd like to see added.
